==============
Monte Carlo Localization (MCL) (or one of its derivates) is a popular method
for mobile robot
  localisation. We consider the 2D case here, i.e. the robot uses a 2D map. Its
  position estimate,
  or briefly pose, within the map is a 3D vector (x, y, Ï†). In MCL, the pose is
  probabilistic and
  represented using sample sets.
